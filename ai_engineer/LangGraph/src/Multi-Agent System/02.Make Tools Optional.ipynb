    "- There are at least two assistant responses for each input, the tool output, and the chatbot's output before it ends. This means the model can intepret the tool outputs and provide something more user-friendly than parsing the raw tool outputs.\n",
    "- Generating plots is still a little dodgy. This is because we have one agent managing all of our tools. Creating agents that specialize in specific tasks in the natural next step, so let's try this out!"
