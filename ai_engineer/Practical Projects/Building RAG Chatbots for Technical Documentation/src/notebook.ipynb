{"cells":[{"source":"![A car dashboard with lots of new technical features.](images/dashboard.jpg)\n\nYou're working for a well-known car manufacturer who is looking at implementing LLMs into vehicles to provide guidance to drivers. You've been asked to experiment with integrating car manuals with an LLM to create a context-aware chatbot. They hope that this context-aware LLM can be hooked up to a text-to-speech software to read the model's response aloud.\n\nAs a proof of concept, you'll integrate several pages from a car manual that contains car warning messages and their meanings and recommended actions. This particular manual, stored as an HTML file, `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`, is from an MG ZS, a compact SUV. Armed with your newfound knowledge of LLMs and LangChain, you'll implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create the context-aware chatbot.\n\n## Before you start\n\nIn order to complete the project you will need to create a developer account with OpenAI and store your API key as a secure environment variable. Instructions for these steps are outlined below.\n\n### Create a developer account with OpenAI\n\n1. Go to the [API signup page](https://platform.openai.com/signup). \n\n2. Create your account (you'll need to provide your email address and your phone number).\n\n3. Go to the [API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). \n\n4. Create a new secret key.\n\n<img src=\"images/openai-new-secret-key.png\" width=\"200\">\n\n5. **Take a copy of it**. (If you lose it, delete the key and create a new one.)\n\n### Add a payment method\n\nOpenAI sometimes provides free credits for the API, but this can vary depending on geography. You may need to add debit/credit card details. \n\n**This project should cost much less than 1 US cents with `gpt-4o-mini` (but if you rerun tasks, you will be charged every time).**\n\n1. Go to the [Payment Methods page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/payment-methods).\n\n2. Click Add payment method.\n\n<img src=\"images/openai-add-payment-method.png\" width=\"200\">\n\n3. Fill in your card details.\n\n### Add an environmental variable with your OpenAI key\n\n1. In the workbook, click on \"Environment,\" in the top toolbar and select \"Environment variables\".\n\n2. Click \"Add\" to add environment variables.\n\n3. In the \"Name\" field, type \"OPENAI_API_KEY\". In the \"Value\" field, paste in your secret key.\n\n<img src=\"images/datalab-env-var-details.png\" width=\"500\">\n\n4. Click \"Create\", then you'll see the following pop-up window. Click \"Connect,\" then wait 5-10 seconds for the kernel to restart, or restart it manually in the Run menu.\n\n<img src=\"images/connect-integ.png\"
